                        <p style={{fontFamily:"Comic Sans MS"}}>In 2012, while being in my own depressed situation, there was a ray of lessons to recieve at Belaku, an Orphanage in Tyagarajnagar. The kids who are unprivileged to have their guardians inspired me to take step into making more for those deprived of their fundamental needs. There after my visits to Belaku became regular to celebrate all my friend's birthdays and festivals. I also found another place to render my charity service, that is Sai old-age home, Sunkadakatte. As I was a graduate student, financial support came from the savings of my pockey money. "Belaku" old-age home near Ragigudda is another place which I used to visit almost all Fridays back then. That is when few of my friends showed their interest to get along with me to make it bigger.</p>

                            While my journey was going in the path of social activities, so may negative came though, thought of expanding our helping hands. Initially, we started many activities in the name of "Spreading Smiles" across Bangalore. We started celebrating birthdays, festivals, national days in old-age homes and orphanages by providing food and sweets. But we wanted to make it across Karnataka, so I travelled across regions, met people, visited many institutions requesting aid for our charity business. We developed our network in more than ten districts. We also started conducting few educational activites in government schools. Later to secure our activities legally we registered out group under Karnataka Socities Act in <b>December 2013</b> in the name of <b><i>"AMRUTHA BINDU"</i></b>. In this journey of good doings, I have had hindrances, recieved many demotivating comments. But I have confidence in the genuineness of my work. We will continue to extend the helping hands.
